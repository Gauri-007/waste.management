    <h1> Waste Management </h1>

         <div class="wm-col">
        <h1> What waste management actually is? </h1>
        <p> In the simplest terms, it can be defined as the collection, transportation, and disposal of garbage, sewage, and other waste products. The process of waste management involves treating solid and liquid waste. During the treatment, it also offers a variety of solutions for recycling items that aren’t categorized as trash. The entire idea thus boils down to re-using garbage as a valuable resource and given our current environmental climate, this process is extremely vital for all households and businesses. </p>
        </div> 
        
    </div>
    <div class="wm-col">
        <h1> How waste management can help a community?</h1>
<p>When waste management is handled properly it has several benefits for the local community. As well as avoiding the negative impact of the above problems, it can also be a vehicle for change. Through job creation and an improvement in health whole communities can be given a new lease of life. <br><br>
Recycling can also be used to reduce future waste by ensuring a portion of solid waste is reused. Whether it’s on a small local scale, or a larger industrial scale, many useful things can be generated from proper waste disposal. Everything from electricity generated through incineration and composting, to furniture being built from recycled plastics, are projects being refined all over the world.Recycling also helps to conserve local resources by reducing the need to manufacture using new raw materials.</p>
        <div class="wm-col">
            <h1>Benefits of Waste Management</h1>
<dl>
<dt><h2>Better Environment</h2> </dt>
    <dd> Probably the biggest advantage of managing waste is that it eventually leads to a better and fresher environment. Waste disposal units also contribute to the well-being of people by helping them become disease-free. The best part: all of this happens while the unnecessary is duly disposed of in a proper and sanitary manner. This will also help implement remarkable safety measures in the long run.</dd>
                
<dt><h2>Reduces Pollution</h2></dt>
    <dd>When waste is managed the right way, it doesn’t merely eliminate the subsequent waste but also reduces the impact and the intensity of harmful greenhouse gases like carbon-di-oxide, carbon mono-oxide, and methane that are often exuded from accumulated wastes in landfills.</dd>
    
<dt><h2>Conserves Energy</h2></dt>
    <dd>Recycling is one of the biggest aspects of waste management, and over time, it helps conserve energy. One of the biggest instances of this advantage can be traced to the practice of recycling paper. All of us are probably aware that thousands of trees are cut to produce paper. When a used paper is recycled to create new paper, the need of cutting trees is significantly minimized. This helps conserve energy while also reducing your carbon footprints.</dd>
</dl>
      <div class="wm-col">
          <h1>Various Methods of Waste Disposal</h1>
          <dl>
          <dt><h2> Landfills </h2></dt>
          <dd> Throwing daily waste/garbage in the landfills is the most popularly used method of waste disposal used today. This process of waste disposal focuses attention on burying the waste in the land. Landfills are commonly found in developing countries. Landfills give rise to air and water pollution which severely affects the environment and can prove fatal to the lives of humans and animals. Many areas are reconsidering the use of landfills. </dd>
          
          <dt><h2>Incineration/Combustion</h2></dt>
          <dd>Incineration or combustion is a type disposal method in which municipal solid wastes are burned at high temperatures. The process eventually converts them into residues and gaseous products. The biggest advantage of this type of method is that it can reduce the volume of solid waste to 20 to 30 percent of the original volume. Additionally, it also decreases the space they take up while also reducing the stress on landfills.</dd>
          
          <dt><h2>Recovery and Recycling</h2></dt>
          <dd>Recycling is the process of converting waste products into new products to prevent energy usage and consumption of fresh raw materials. Recycling is the third component of Reduce, Reuse and Recycle waste hierarchy. The idea behind recycling is to reduce energy usage, reduce the volume of landfills, reduce air and water pollution, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and preserve natural resources for future use.</dd>
              
        <dt><h2>Composting</h2></dt>
              <img src="images/Composting%20bg.jpeg" align-"right" height="500" width="400">
              <dd>Composting is an easy and natural bio-degradation process that takes organic wastes i.e. remains of plants and garden and kitchen waste and turns into nutrient-rich food for your plants. Composting, normally used for organic farming, occurs by allowing organic materials to sit in one place for months until microbes decompose it.</dd>
              
        <dt><h2>Avoidance/Waste Minimization</h2></dt>
              <dd>The easier method of waste management is to reduce the creation of waste materials thereby reducing the amount of waste going to landfills. Waste reduction can be done through recycling old materials like jar, bags, repairing broken items instead of buying a new one, avoiding the use of disposable products like plastic bags, reusing second-hand items, and buying items that use less designing.</dd>
          </dl>
    <div class="wm-col">
        <h1>The Best Methods of Waste Management</h1>
        <p>Recycling and composting are a couple of the best methods of waste management. Composting is so far only possible on a small scale, either by private individuals or in areas where waste can be mixed with farming soil or used for landscaping purposes. Recycling, on the other hand, can be widely used around the world, with plastic, paper, and metal leading the list of the most recyclable items.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="wm-col">
              <h1>Types of Waste</h1>
              <p>There are 6 types of waste which includes</p> 
              <ol type="i">
                  <li>E-waste</li>
                  <li>Plastic</li> 	
                  <li>Organic</li>
                  <li>Paper</li>

                  <li>Metal</li>
              </ol>
              <p>And, the amazing fact is that we have different coloured dustbins to throw this waste. Let’s learn about these waste.</p>
